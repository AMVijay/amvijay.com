# Linear Data Structure

## What is Linear Data Structure
Linear Data Structure is about how collection of data stored and retrieved in sequencial way. Array, List, Stack and Queues are of linear data structure types. Each of these has its own way of linear data structure implmentation. 

## Array - How Linear Data Structure Implemented
Array uses sequential index for each element added to the data collection, and its retrives the data using the same index value. 

### Data Storage

### Data Retrival
* Data is retrived used index value from array.

## List
List uses the pointers (memory location address in which data stored in memory) to organize the data as collection. Compared to Array, Stack and List, adding new data to anywhere in the List will be efficient as the pointers of sequence need to be updated as required. 

## Stack
Stack uses the LIFO (Last In First Out) method to add and retrive the data as collection. 

## Queue
Queue uses the FIFO (First In First Out) method to add and retrive the data as collection.

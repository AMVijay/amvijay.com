# Linear Data Structure

## What is Linear Data Structure
Linear Data Structure is about how collection of data stored and retrieved in sequencial way. Array, List, Stack and Queues are of linear data structure types. Each of these has its own way of linear data structure implmentation. 

## Array
* Array uses sequential index for each element added to the data collection, and it retrives the data using the same index value quickly.
* If Array is created for the data collection ["apple","ball","cat","dog"], then it will look like 
	* 1 -> apple
	* 2 -> ball
	* 3 -> cat
	* 4 -> dog

## List
* List uses the pointers (memory location address in which data stored in memory) to organize the data as collection. 
* Compared to Array, Stack and List, adding new data to anywhere in the List will be efficient as the pointers of sequence need to be updated as required. 

## Stack
* Stack uses the LIFO (Last In First Out) method to add and retrive the data as collection. 
* Here, index or pointers are not used to organize the sequence. 
* The order in which elements are added will be maintained. 
* But Last Element will be the first one to be retrieved from collection, can't traverse to any other elements by skipping the last element. 

## Queue
* Queue uses the FIFO (First In First Out) method to add and retrive the data as collection.
* Here, index or pointers are not used to organize the sequence. 
* The order in which elements are added will be maintained. 
* But First Element will be the first one to be retrieved from collection, can't traverse to any other elements by skipping the first element.

<li>ViewResolver is getting initialized in DispatcherServlet.</li>
<li>For all the ModelAndView return type from controller method, ViewResolver adds the location of view in deployed war and adds the extension of the view file (jsp, html).</li>
<li>Then, java web server renders the jsp with model object in server side and sends back the http response to client .</li>
